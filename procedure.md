# Procedure

##### Changing a Bike Tire
1) Loosen the nuts that hold the axle to the frame. <br/>
2) Release the brakes if your bike is equipped with them - this prevents them interfering with wheel removal. <br/>
3) Take the wheel out of the frame. <br/>
4) Deflate the tube completely by pressing down on the inner part of the inflation valve. This can be done with a screwdriver. <br/>

5) Loosen the tire tred from the wheel rim by squeezing the tire together all the way around the rim. <br/>
6) Use a couple of tire levers to remove the tred completely (you can purchase these at your local bike/outdoor store). <br/>

9) Thoroughly inspect the inside wall of the tire by rubbing along the entire surface area and inspect the rim for glass, nails, thorns, or any object that may have punctured the tube. <br/>
10) Either patch, or replace the inner tube. You may have to competely replace your tube and tire if both are torn severely. <br/>

11) Place the new tube into the tire ensuring the tub is not twisted at all and fill the tube with a few pumps of air. <br/>
12) Work the tire onto the rim one side at a time. <br/>
13) Make sure that no part of the tube is sticking out, screw on the lock ring and inflate the tube slowly and carefully at first, all the time checking to make sure the tire is on evenly and there is no "pinching". <br/>
14) Remove the pump and hand tighten the presta screw and lock ring. <br/>
15) Put the repaired wheel back on the bike. <br/>
16) Re-tension the brakes and/or chain if doing back wheel. <br/>
17) Ensure that the chain is aligned after replacment. <br/>
18) Enjoy your repaired bike! <br/>
