# {{ FAQ }} 

Q: How do I prevent over-inflation? 
A: See the recommended pressure listed on your tire wall.

Q: My tube does not fit the rim - what am I doing wrong?
A: Make sure that if your rims are drilled for Presta valves, you use those tubes instead of Schrader.

Q: Should I oil the brakes?
A: No, don't get any sort of oil on the brakes or brake surfaces. Avoid getting oil on the tires or tubes, too, since oil can cause rubber to decay.

Q: Is there anything I need to know about quick releases? 
A:If your bike has a quick release on the back wheel be very careful with the axle. Handle it carefully and put it where it will not get stood upon while you're changing the tire. A slight bend will mean buying a whole new axle.

Q: Even without major physical harm, how long should my tires and tubes last?
A:Tires and tubes deteriorate after about 10-15 years, (7 years if exposed to the UV light) so if your tubes and tires are older than 10 years, consider replacing them.

Q: I just installed an new tube, but itâ€™s not inflating.
A: Uh, oh. While refitting your punctured tire, carefully check inside the tire (under the tread) with your fingers - the object that puncture the tire may still be lodged inside tire. This probably caused a puncture to the new tube as soon as it was inflated! If this is the case, carefully remove it.

Q: Cracks are appearing on the fabric piles - what should I do?
A: You should replace both the tire and the inner tube (if it's still the original tube that came with that tire). If the two tires on the bicycle are the same age, replace both even though only one may look bad. Otherwise you risk a blowout. Properly installed new tires are just as important as wearing a helmet. 

Q: What can I do to check to make sure the patched tire is fit for use?
A: Before reassembling the patched tube into the tire, put a little air into the tube to check whether there is a second puncture that needs fixing.
